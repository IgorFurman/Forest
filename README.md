# 🌳 Forest Website - Interactive and Captivating 🚀

Welcome to **Forest**, a beautifully designed interactive website for a fictional outdoor adventure services company. The project language is Polish 🇵🇱. This website is visually appealing, combining engaging images and compelling content to provide an excellent user experience.

#### 🔗 Live Application: [Forest Website](https://igorfurman.github.io/ForestWebside/)

## 📐 Structure

The application has been meticulously crafted, offering a main page, contact page, and offer details page. Let's go through each of these parts:

### 🌳 Forest (Main Page)

This is the home page of the website, consisting of several sections:

- **👋 Header**: The site starts with a captivating header showcasing the company's name and slogan.
- **🌐 Navigation bar**: A user-friendly tool allowing users to traverse different sections of the site. The mobile version is also well-optimized for smaller screens.
- **👥 About us**: This section features a detailed description of the company, a banner promoting family adventures, and a captivating image depicting their operations.
- **🏷️ Offers**: Presents different pricing tiers for the services provided by the company, with detailed lists of what's included and what's not.
- **🔖 Footer**: This section provides more information about the company, career opportunities, and documentation.

### 📞 Contact Page

The contact page includes a user-friendly form facilitating user interactions. The form requests necessary information like the name, email, and the intended message. Moreover, it features the company's physical address, operating hours, and a Google Maps widget indicating the location.

### 🌄 Offer Page

This page showcases a variety of outdoor activities available for selection. Each activity is presented within its own container, making the user experience straightforward and engaging. There are nine diverse activities in total, catering to a broad range of preferences and skill levels.

## 🖥️ JavaScript

The functionality of the website is powered by JavaScript, providing features like:

- **🍔 Burger Menu**: A responsive navigation bar, with an easy-to-use burger menu for smaller screens.
- **🎯 Scrollspy**: A user-friendly feature for seamless navigation around the website.
- **📅 Footer Year**: Dynamically displays the current year in the footer.

## 🛠️ Gulp & related extensions in json file

I used **Gulp** as a task runner for automating tasks like Sass/SCSS compilation, auto-prefixing of CSS properties, minification of CSS and JavaScript files, running the local server, and auto-reloading the browser. Gulp settings can be customized as per requirements in the gulpfile.js.
